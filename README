This is the the first Game I ever made, and the worst code I ever wrote!
Why? Because I didn't know anything about Objects back then :D
However the game is really fun to play
I wish I have time to refactor it and add LAN multiplayer to it :)

You need Visual Studio 2010 (or Visual C# 2010) and XNA 4.0 Refresh to compile this.
